dh-exec (0.12) unstable; urgency=low

  * The test suite was cleaned up and migrated from a custom solution to BATS.
  * Fixed a possible crash when DH_EXEC_SCRIPTDIR pointed to a
    non-existing directory.
  * Handle --help and unknown arguments separately, for better error
    reporting in the latter case.
  * Depend on perl instead of perl-modules.
  * Standards-Version bumped to 3.9.5 (no changes necessary).

dh-exec (0.11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Do not allow spaces in neither source nor destination when renaming
    files via dh-exec-install. That would make the syntax far more
    complicated, and this way, we can just disallow whitespace and get rid
    of the trailing ones too. Thanks to Chow Loong Jin
    <hyperair@debian.org> for the patch.
  * Strip the output of any comment or whitespace-only lines, even when
    dh-exec was called with the --with-scripts option. Thanks to Dann
    Frazier <dannf@debian.org> and Daniel Schepler <dschepler@gmail.com>
    for reporting the issue. (Closes: #711937)

dh-exec (0.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Build-Depend on automake (>= 1:1.11), to force a suitable automake
    version into unclean environments too.

dh-exec (0.9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Strip the output of any comment or whitespace-only lines, because
    debhelper does not do that for executable scripts. Thanks to Chow
    Loong Jin for noticing!
  * Removed the debian/watch file, it is fairly useless for a native
    package. Thanks lintian & the PTS.

dh-exec (0.8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Handle empty variables correctly in dh-exec-subst-env: use their empty
    value, instead of opting for the fallback. Thanks Chow Loong Jin for
    the patch! (Closes: #711643)

dh-exec (0.7) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Preserve permissions when renaming files. Many thanks to Axel Beckert
    for the report & help in tracking this down. (Closes: #706939).
  * Since we're using File::Copy::cp, depend on perl-modules >= 5.14.2~,
    which is in wheezy (the File::Copy in Squeeze doesn't have cp). Also
    thanks to Axel Beckert for the note.
  * Urgency medium, because not preserving permissions is a serious
    regression.

dh-exec (0.6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Make dh-exec-install work on bare debian/install files, without the
    package name. Thanks, Axel Beckert for the report! (Closes: #698017).

 -- Gergely Nagy <algernon@madhouse-project.org>  Sun, 13 Jan 2013 01:08:02 +0100

dh-exec (0.5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Drop the AC_PREREQ from configure.ac, to make backporting
    easier. (Closes: #696199)

 -- Gergely Nagy <algernon@madhouse-project.org>  Fri, 21 Dec 2012 12:46:40 +0100

dh-exec (0.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add Vcs-* fields, thanks Wookey for the report!
  * Improved the sub-command man pages based on Wookey's suggestions.
  * Bump build-depends on debhelper to >= 9~, and remove the Lintian
    override.

 -- Gergely Nagy <algernon@madhouse-project.org>  Sat, 30 Jun 2012 12:24:48 +0200

dh-exec (0.3) unstable; urgency=low

    examples to the README. (Closes: #664698)
