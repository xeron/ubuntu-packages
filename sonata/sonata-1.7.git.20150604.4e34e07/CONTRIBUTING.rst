Contributing
============

If you are interested to hack on Sonata, please consider the following:

#. Clone the repository or fork it on Github;
#. **For each** feature, bug fix, refactor, anything, you want to submit, create
   a branch with a name which reflects what you want to do;
#. Commit your changes related to *this* thing in this branch;
#. Signal your changes with one of the following:

   * open a pull request on Github;
   * send a mail to jon@multani.info with the URL of your repository, the
     name of the branch you want to be merged, and a meaningful description of
     your work;
   * or send me your patch(es) to jon@multani.info using ``git send-email``.

I hate, hate, *hate* having to review commits touching lot of unrelated things,
this is the easiest way for your changes not to be merged. Try to stay focus on
one clearly defined thing and it should be much easier to merge.

Translations
------------

.. note:: See the `TRANSLATORS` file for more information!

You can translate Sonata using the `dedicated Transifex project
page <https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/sonata/>`_.

Sonata's translation can be done via the `Transifex`_ plateform. You need to
subscribe to `Transifex`_ first, then to add yourself as a member of the
`Transifex Sonata`_ project under the language your are interested to translate
into.

Once a translation is done, *be sure to contact the maintainer of Sonata* to
announce there's a new translation to include!

Website
-------

The website content is hosted in the `website directory in Git
<https://github.com/multani/sonata/tree/master/website>`. You can provide an
update by submitting a pull request or sending a patch, as explained above, on
this repository.

.. note: Sonata's website is now hosted on Savannah, which requires the
    website's content to be uploaded through CVS. This is not really optimal,
    but have a look at http://savannah.gnu.org/maintenance/HomepageUpload/ for
    reference.
