Sonata provides a quick and easy way of creating a translation for
your language. If you find this software useful and are capable of
adding a language that has not yet been translated, it would be
greatly appreciated.

Sonata uses the `Transifex plateform
<https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/sonata/>`_ as a translation helping
plateform, although you can probably also use any `gettext` compatible
translation editor.

In order to add a new translation or update a new translation, you can subscribe
to the `Transifex <https://www.transifex.com>`_ project and add yourself to the
team of translators according to your preferred language on the `Sonata project
page <https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/sonata/>`_.

Once you have a new translation ready, feel free to contact the Sonat's mailing
list at sonata@lists.berlis.de (registration required at
https://lists.nongnu.org/mailman/listinfo/sonata beforehand) or to contact the
author by email so your translation will be included in the next release!


Instrutions (mostly for developers)
===================================

Using Transifex
---------------

You need the `Transifex client <http://help.transifex.com/features/client/>`_ and
to configure your Transifex configuration file (probably ``~/.transifexrc``)
according to `the official
documentation <http://help.transifex.com/features/client/#transifexrc>`_::

    [https://www.transifex.com]
    hostname = https://www.transifex.com
    token =

    username = YOUR TRANSIFEX USERNAME
    password = YOUR TRANSIFEX PASSWORD

You can use then the ``tx`` command line tool to get or send the translation
files from/to Transifex:

    To refresh the translation strings on Transifex (so that new translation
    strings are available to translators)::

        $ tx push -s

    To get/update translations from/to Transifex::

        $ tx pull -l fr # Get the latest French translation from transifex.com
        ...
        $ tx push -t fr # Send the latest French translation to transifex.com


You can read the `officiel Transifex
documentation <http://help.transifex.com/features/client/>`_ for more information
about using the Transifex client.


Managing the translation without Transifex
------------------------------------------

You can use the script in ``script/update-po`` which wraps ``intltool``, or
directly ``intltool`` if you want, to manage the translation directly from the
Sonata repository.

.. warning:: Note that Transifex is the preferred plateform to manage
    translations, and that it should be keep up-to-date with respect to the
    content of the source tree.
