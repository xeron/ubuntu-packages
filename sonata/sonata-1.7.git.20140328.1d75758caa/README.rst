Using Sonata
============

Requirements
------------

In order to run Sonata, you will need the following dependencies:

* Python >= 3.2
* `PyGObject`_ (aka Python GObject Introspection) (3.7.4 or more recommended,
  earlier versions may also work)
* GTK >= 3.4
* `python-mpd2` >= 0.4.6
* MPD >= 0.15 (possibly on another computer)
* taglib and tagpy >= 2013.1 for editing metadata (Optional)
* dbus-python for multimedia keys (Optional)

.. warning: Sonata depends on `PyGObject`_ which is still quite new and gets
    regular fixes. Although versions 3.4.x shipped in most distributions at the
    time of writing are OK most of the time, unexpected bugs may occur which are
    fixed by more recent versions.

Sonata can currently be downloaded from the Git repository using::

    $ git clone git://github.com/multani/sonata.git
    $ cd sonata

To run Sonata, you can either install it in a dedicated directory (as root)::

    # python setup.py install

Or you can run it straight from the directory (without prior installation)::

    $ ./run-sonata

Website, documentation, help, etc.
==================================

The official documentation is located at
http://sonata.berlios.de/documentation.html

There's a (somewhat alive) mailing list available at

Contributing
============

If you are interested to hack on Sonata, please consider the following:

#. Clone the repository or fork it on Github;
#. **For each** feature, bug fix, refactor, anything, you want to submit, create
   a branch with a name which reflects what you want to do;
#. Commit your changes related to *this* thing in this branch;
#. Signal your changes with one of the following:

   * open a pull request on Github;
   * send a mail to jon@multani.info with the URL of your repository, the
     name of the branch you want to be merged, and a meaningful description of
     your work;
   * or send me your patch(es) to jon@multani.info using ``git send-email``.

I hate, hate, *hate* having to review commits touching lot of unrelated things,
this is the easiest way for your changes not to be merged. Try to stay focus on
one clearly defined thing and it should be much easier to merge.

Translations
------------

.. note:: See the `TRANSLATORS` file for more information!

You can translate Sonata using the `dedicated Transifex project
page <https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/sonata/>`_.

Sonata's translation can be done via the `Transifex`_ plateform. You need to
subscribe to `Transifex`_ first, then to add yourself as a member of the
`Transifex Sonata`_ project under the language your are interested to translate
into.

Once a translation is done, *be sure to contact the maintainer of Sonata* to
announce there's a new translation to include!

You can also find Sonata in other places on the Internet:

* http://sonata.berlios.de/ : this is the original Sonata website. It has not
  been updated since a while but still has interesting screenshots.
* http://codingteam.net/project/sonata/ : this is another fork with a different
  team and different perspectives. Our code bases diverge quite a bit now.
