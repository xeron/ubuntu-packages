Description: Universally Unique ID library
 The libuuid library generates and parses 128-bit universally unique
 ids (UUIDs).  A UUID is an identifier that is unique across both
 space and time, with respect to the space of all UUIDs.  A UUID can
 be used for multiple purposes, from tagging objects with an extremely
 short lifetime, to reliably identifying very persistent objects
 across a network.

Description: runtime components for the Universally Unique ID library
 The libuuid library generates and parses 128-bit universally unique
 ids (UUIDs).  A UUID is an identifier that is unique across both
 space and time, with respect to the space of all UUIDs.  A UUID can
 be used for multiple purposes, from tagging objects with an extremely
 short lifetime, to reliably identifying very persistent objects
 across a network.
 .
 See RFC 4122 for more information.
 .
 This package contains the uuidgen program and the uuidd daemon.
 .
 The uuidd daemon is used to generate UUIDs, especially time-based
 UUID’s, in a secure and guaranteed-unique fashion, even in the face
 of large numbers of threads trying to grab UUID’s running on
 different CPU’s. It is used by libuuid as well as the uuidgen
 program.
