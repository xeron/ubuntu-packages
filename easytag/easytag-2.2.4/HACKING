Hacking on EasyTAG
==================

Contributing
------------

If you have a suggestion or found a bug, please either file a bug:

https://bugzilla.gnome.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=easytag

or bring it up on the mailing list:

easytag-list@gnome.org

Patches are best filed on Bugzilla, but a pull request is also fine. For
patches, please:

* keep the first line of the commit messages at 50 characters or less
* do not add a prefix to the commit message, for example "build:"
* provide patches created with "git format-patch"
* add a link to the bug report or mailing list archives where the patch was
  discussed, for example "bug 987654" for GNOME Bugzilla or a URL for other
  services

Coding Style
------------

The original EasyTAG coding style was close to K&R style, with four-space
indents. This has been changed slightly to the following guidelines:

* BSD/Allman brace style
* one space before opening bracket, none after opening or closing
* four space indent
* try to keep to 80 character lines
* space after ',', spaces around logical operators
* function return values on a line separate from the function name

New code should follow this style.
