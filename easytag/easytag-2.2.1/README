Description

EasyTAG is a utility for viewing and editing tags for MP3, MP2, FLAC, Ogg
Vorbis, Speex, MP4/AAC, MusePack, Monkey's Audio and WavPack files. Its simple

### Compilation instructions

See INSTALL.


Segfault occurs when running EasyTAG?
-------------------------------------

The best way to allow us to fix the problem, is to send a backtrace:

#### Be sure that core files are available

If `ulimit -c` returns 0, then run the command `ulimit -c unlimited`

Get the backtrace with 'gdb easytag core' (note that on some systems, the core
file is suffixed by the pid. So use 'core._pid_number_' instead of only
'core').
    
    gdb easytag core._pid_number_
    gdb> bt
    gdb> ...
    gdb> l
    gdb> ...
