  <title>Add an image to a file</title>

  <p>Most audio file formats support an <sys>image</sys> tag field which can
  be used to add cover art and other related images to the audio file.</p>

  <p>To add an image to the file, select the file, open the
  <gui style="tab">Images</gui> tab and press the <gui style="button">Add
  images to the tag</gui> button. Select the image and confirm your
  selection.</p>

  <p>Once the image is uploaded, it will be automatically marked as a front
  cover and the description will be the filename. To change the
  <gui>type</gui> and <gui>description</gui>, press the
  <gui style="button">Edit image properties</gui> button. Once you have made
  the changes, press <gui style="button">OK</gui> to apply the changes.</p>

  <note>
    <p>Your changes will not be saved automatically.</p>
  </note>

  <p>You can tag multiple files with the same image by selecting them in the
  list of files, then selecting the image and pressing the
  <gui style="button">Tag selected files with these images</gui> button. You
  will need to save these changes to write them to the files.</p>

  <p>You can work with more than one image at a time by selecting those images
  before you edit, apply, save to file or delete them.</p>

  <note>
    <p>Not all files support the image field. <sys>mp4</sys> files are one
    example of files that do not support this field.</p>
